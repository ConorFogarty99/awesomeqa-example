## Testing

###  Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

![alt text](images/GHAimages.png)

GitHub Actions is used automate testing for both the backend and frontend components upon every commit and pull request, ensuring that all changes are verified before integration.
Backend tests are conducted using Pytest to simulate API behavior and validate the responses against expected outcomes with a suite of unit and integration tests.

###  Backend Testing

Mock data is employed to create a controlled testing environment, allowing us to verify the functionality of all REST API endpoints under various scenarios.
Tests cover a range of cases, including successful data retrieval, error handling, and state changes caused by actions like ticket deletion and status updates.

###  Frontend Testing

Frontend testing is performed to ensure that the user interface behaves as expected, including rendering components and user interactions.
Automated tests check the integration of the frontend with the backend services, ensuring that the UI correctly displays data from the API and sends requests based on user actions.

### API Testing using Postman

#### Note
Test coverage is not complete. If I had more time I would have tried to cover all edge cases. More tests are needed.
